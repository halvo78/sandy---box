## ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRES ATTENTION (Blocking Production)

**Security Infrastructure** - Score of 93.4/100 requires enterprise-grade improvements including production SSL certificates from trusted Certificate Authorities, enterprise firewall and port security implementation, hardware security modules for encryption, network security appliances, and third-party security auditing with penetration testing.

---

## üö´ IMMEDIATE BLOCKERS

**SSL Certificates** - Production certificates from trusted CA required (currently using self-signed certificates unsuitable for production).

**Port Security** - Enterprise-grade firewall and port management system required for production security standards.

**Encryption Infrastructure** - Hardware security modules and end-to-end encryption required for financial system compliance.

**Security Audit** - Third-party security audit and professional penetration testing required before live deployment.
