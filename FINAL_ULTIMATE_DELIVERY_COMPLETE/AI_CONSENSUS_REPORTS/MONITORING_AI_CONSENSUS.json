  "GPT-4o": "To design an optimal monitoring architecture for a live cryptocurrency trading platform, we will integrate a comprehensive solution utilizing the following components:\n\n### 1. Real-Time Trading Anomaly Detection\n- **Data Ingestion**: Utilize Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming from the exchange APIs and AI models.\n- **Anomaly Detection**: Deploy a clustering-based anomaly detection system using Apache Flink and ML models that can process real-time trade data and detect anomalies by monitoring deviations from historical trading patterns.\n- **Alerting**: Integrate with AWS SNS to send alerts to the DevOps team for immediate investigation.\n\n### 2. System Health Metrics\n- **Metrics Collection**: Utilize Prometheus for collecting metrics from all services, including server health (CPU, Memory, Disk usage), network latency to exchange APIs, and AI model response times.\n- **Visualization**: Use Grafana for dashboards that display these metrics with historical and real-time data views.\n\n### 3. Security Event Monitoring\n- **Log Management**: Implement AWS CloudWatch Logs for aggregating logs from various components, including API access logs, Ngrok activity, and Guardian Vault transactions.\n- **Intrusion Detection**: Use AWS GuardDuty for real-time threat detection and AWS Detective to investigate anomalies or unauthorized access attempts.\n- **Alerts**: Configure AWS Lambda functions to analyze logs and trigger alerts in case of suspicious activities, using AWS SNS or Slack integration for notifications.\n\n### 4. API Failure Alerts\n- **API Monitoring**: Utilize AWS CloudWatch Synthetic Canaries to continuously test exchange API endpoints for uptime and performance.\n- **Alerting**: Configure CloudWatch Alarms to trigger thresholds for response time and downtime, sending alerts via AWS SNS.\n\n### 5. KPI Dashboard Design\n- **Dashboard Platform**: Use Grafana, which can consolidate all metrics into a cohesive KPI dashboard visible on multiple devices.\n- **Key KPIs**: Include metrics such as active trades, profit/loss tracking, latency of trades, API request error rates, and AI model prediction accuracy.\n- **Organizational Customization**: Implement user-specific dashboards defining roles (e.g., Traders, DevOps, Security analysts) to view personalized KPIs relevant to their operations.\n\n### Integration and Automation\n- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Utilize AWS CodePipeline for the CI/CD process, integrating with Docker for containerization, ensuring isolated and controlled deploys.\n- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager for dynamic and encrypted storage of the 204 secrets, allowing access control by role and automating secret rotation.\n- **Backup and Recovery**: Implement AWS Backup to configure automated and reliable backup plans, ensuring minimal downtime in case of a failure.\n\n### Compliance and Reporting\n- **Audit Trails**: Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture API calls and save them for audit purposes, keeping a complete log of interactions with AWS resources.\n- **Reporting**: Regularly generate security and performance reports using AWS Config, which evaluates changes in configuration and compliance over time.\n\nThis architecture ensures a robust, secure, and high-performance environment that scales with the demands of the trading platform, while providing real-time insight and proactive alerting to maintain operational integrity.",
  "DeepSeek R1": "**Monitoring Architecture for Crypto Trading Platform**  \n\n**1. Real-Time Trading Anomaly Detection**  \n- **Streaming Pipeline**: Deploy Apache Kafka for real-time trade data ingestion from 8 exchanges. Use Apache Flink with custom AI/ML models (via OpenRouter) to detect anomalies (e.g., volume spikes, capital overexposure >5% of $13.9K).  \n- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Apply statistical models (Z-score, moving percentiles) to adjust alert thresholds based on market volatility.  \n- **Actionable Alerts**: Route anomalies to PagerDuty/Slack with severity tiers. Store anomalies in TimescaleDB for forensic analysis.  \n\n**2. System Health Metrics**  \n- **Metrics Collection**: Use Prometheus +"
