# Portfolio Optimization & Risk Management Libraries

## PyPortfolioOpt
**Modern Portfolio Theory Implementation** - PyPortfolioOpt provides classical mean-variance optimization techniques and Black-Litterman allocation models for constructing optimal portfolios that maximize returns while minimizing risk.

**Key Features:**
- Efficient frontier calculation
- Black-Litterman model for incorporating market views
- Risk parity portfolio construction
- Maximum Sharpe ratio optimization
- Minimum volatility portfolios

## skfolio
**Scikit-Learn Compatible Portfolio Optimization** - Built on top of scikit-learn, skfolio offers a unified interface for portfolio optimization and risk management with machine learning integration.

**Integration Benefits:**
- Compatible with scikit-learn pipelines
- Cross-validation for portfolio strategies
- Multiple optimization objectives
- Risk-adjusted performance metrics

## Cvxportfolio
**Convex Optimization for Portfolio Management** - Uses convex optimization techniques for portfolio construction and rebalancing with backtesting capabilities.

**Advanced Features:**
- Multi-period optimization
- Transaction cost modeling
- Market impact consideration
- Dynamic rebalancing strategies

## Risk Management Integration

**Value at Risk (VaR)** - Quantitative measure of potential portfolio losses over a specific time horizon at a given confidence level.

**Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)** - Expected loss exceeding VaR, providing a more comprehensive risk measure.

**Maximum Drawdown** - Largest peak-to-trough decline in portfolio value, critical for assessing downside risk.

**Sharpe Ratio Optimization** - Risk-adjusted return metric for comparing portfolio performance.

**Kelly Criterion** - Optimal position sizing formula for maximizing long-term capital growth while managing risk.

## Implementation for Ultimate Lyra System

**Dynamic Portfolio Rebalancing** - Continuously optimize asset allocation based on market conditions and AI predictions using PyPortfolioOpt's efficient frontier.

**Risk Parity Approach** - Balance risk contributions across different crypto assets to avoid concentration risk.

**Black-Litterman Integration** - Combine AI market views with historical data for more robust portfolio construction.

**Multi-Objective Optimization** - Simultaneously optimize for returns, risk, and other constraints using skfolio's framework.

**Transaction Cost Awareness** - Use Cvxportfolio's cost modeling to minimize slippage and fees in high-frequency rebalancing.

**Real-Time Risk Monitoring** - Calculate VaR, CVaR, and maximum drawdown in real-time to trigger circuit breakers when risk limits are exceeded.

**Position Sizing** - Apply Kelly Criterion for optimal position sizing based on AI confidence levels and historical win rates.
