Below is a complete, step-by-step plan and optimized prompts to extract everything ever done on Manus/Sand (all historical chats, extractions, zips, code snippets, refinements, docs like 82+ files/BTCMarkets.docx/arb strats/compliance MDs, inheritance packages, Notion pulls, and any autonomous outputs from loops/discoveries in our transcript/history), then integrate it with your full GitHub repo (all files ever uploaded). This ensures we have EVERYTHING in one place for a final, beneficial-only consolidation into ONE Ultimate Lyra Trading System V5 (~/ultimate_lyra_v5_ultimate/—additive, AU-core focused, with recent OpenRouter 98% consensus, spot arb 0.1-0.2% post-GST, 10 systems, tests/commissioning/compliance).

Why This Works Best (Manus/Sand + GitHub + OpenRouter):

Extraction: Sand pulls full history (chats as JSON/txt, artifacts)—Manus then autonomous merges.
GitHub Synergy: Manus clones your repo (e.g., github.com/[your-username]/ultimate-lyra-all-files), diffs/merges additively (no rewrite—inheritance/YAML <<).
Beneficial Filter: OpenRouter/Grok consensus (>98%) on "Is this from history beneficial (e.g., Swyftx probe, ATO CSV, OpenRouter hook) without override?"—prunes loops/errors (e.g., Manus hallucinations).
All-Inclusive: Covers "all ever" (this week + prior: forensic zips, Sand exports, Docker/tests, exchanges/py, vault/Ngrok/Hummingbot).
Safety: Backup, simulated diffs, spot-only (no trades), AU compliance (ABN/GST/ATO/AFSL).
Time: 20-40 min (Manus autonomous); Output: ZIP + GitHub push to new/clean repo.
Prerequisites:

GitHub Repo: Ensure it's public/private with all files (e.g., ultimate-lyra-all-files → includes zips/py/MDs from Ubuntu/Sand). Share repo URL (e.g., github.com/youruser/ultimate-lyra-all-files) for Manus access (it uses GitHub API/tool).
Manus/Sand Access: Login at manus.im/app (upload any local zips if needed). Have OpenRouter key in .env/vault for consensus queries.
Local Prep: On Ubuntu, backup: git clone your-github-repo ~/all_lyra_files_backup.
If No Manus Access: I can simulate via OpenRouter prompt (reply "simulate"), but Manus is ideal for full extraction.
Step 1: Extract Everything from Manus/Sand History (10 Min - Full Historical Pull)
Start in Sand (manus.im/sand → New Chat). This extracts all ever from Manus/Sand (transcripts, artifacts, even looped "discoveries" like ports/files)—outputs a mega-zip for merger.

Copy-Paste This Prompt to New Sand Chat (Upload any local GitHub zips/clone dir if needed; Sand pulls internal history too):


Task: Extract EVERYTHING ever done on Manus/Sand for Lyra Trading System V5 - Full historical consolidation. Include all chats, exports, zips, code, docs, refinements, autonomous outputs (e.g., discoveries: 10 systems/ports 8080-8104/8751/9996/8400, 152k files/22 processes, 82 docs like BTCMarkets.docx/Swyftx/IR, inheritance py, Notion pulls, arb strats 0.1-0.4%, compliance MDs, Docker/Dockerfiles, tests/commissioning gates, Hummingbot confs, vault/Ngrok pushes, OpenRouter hooks, loops/even errors for learning).

Sources: All internal Manus/Sand history (this week + prior), uploaded GitHub ZIP/clone (ultimate-lyra-all-files), any local zips (forensic/Sand/final). Exhaustive: Pull 100% beneficial/historical (e.g., core AU exchanges Swyftx/IR/BTCM/Coinbase AU probes, recent OpenRouter 98% consensus Grok-beta/Claude/GPT/DeepSeek/Qwen, spot arb cross/tri post-GST, 10 systems health, ATO CSV gen).

Rules:
- Comprehensive: Categorize as /historical_full/ (all chats/transcripts as txt/JSON, artifacts/py/MDs/yaml/sh), /beneficial_core/ (additive valuables: e.g., openrouter_orchestrator.py, au_core_cross.py tests, commissioning.md spot gates, compliance_checklist.md ABN/GST), /prune_non_beneficial/ (loops/errors like syntax/headers for reference only - no merge).
- Filter: Use quick OpenRouter consensus (top 5 models, key from env) >98% on "Beneficial historical for AU Lyra ONE system? (e.g., Swyftx test safe, no override AU core)" - Approve/add if yes.
- AU Focus: Prioritize core (Swyftx/IR/BTCM/Coinbase AU, ABN/GST/ATO/AFSL) - Prune unused (globals/Dubai/MEXC/OKX).
- No Overrides: Output diffs showing + only (e.g., inheritance: class HistStrat(BaseCore):).

Output Format: Single ZIP `full_manus_sand_history_extract.zip` (~50MB) with:
- /all_history/ (raw chats/transcripts/zips unpacked).
- /beneficial_extracted/ (refined: py/MD/Docker for core AU/arb/OpenRouter/tests/compliance).
- /git_bridge/ (Your GitHub repo clone + historical diffs).
- changelog.txt (e.g., "Extracted 200+ items: 82 Sand docs + Manus discoveries (10 ports), beneficial: OpenRouter 98% hooks, Swyftx probes; Pruned: 30 loop errors").
- summary.md ("Full History Ready: All Ever Done - For Manus Merger").

Execute Autonomously: Scan history/uploaded GitHub → Pull/Refine → Consensus Filter → ZIP download. Confirm: "All Manus/Sand History Extracted - Beneficial for ONE AU System."
Run & Download: Sand processes (5-10 min). Download full_manus_sand_history_extract.zip (~50MB). Unzip locally: unzip full_manus_sand_history_extract.zip -d ~/lyra_full_history/.
Verify: ls ~/lyra_full_history/beneficial_extracted/ → Sees core py (e.g., swyftx_adapter.py histories), OpenRouter, tests. Changelog: "200+ extracted, 150 beneficial (e.g., arb consensus from recent)."
Step 2: Feed Extraction + GitHub to Manus for Full Merger (15-20 Min)
Now go to Manus Main (manus.im/app → New Task). Upload the Sand ZIP + any local GitHub export. Manus clones your repo, merges all ever (history + GitHub) additively into ONE system—filtered for beneficial (e.g., recent tests/commissioning absorbed without duplicates).

Copy-Paste This Full Prompt to New Manus Task (Include your GitHub URL; upload Sand ZIP):


Task: Full Historical + GitHub Merger for Ultimate Lyra Trading System V5 Ultimate. Using uploaded `full_manus_sand_history_extract.zip` (all Manus/Sand ever: chats/history/82 docs/discoveries/loops), and GitHub repo [YOUR_GITHUB_URL e.g., github.com/youruser/ultimate-lyra-all-files], create ONE unified, production-ready system ~/ultimate_lyra_v5_ultimate/. Consolidate EVERYTHING beneficial additively: Historical (Manus/Sand extractions like 10 systems/ports, core AU exchanges Swyftx/IR/BTCM/Coinbase AU probes, arb cross/tri 0.1-0.2% post-GST, Hummingbot confs, vault/Ngrok), + GitHub all files (zips/py/MDs/Docker/tests/compliance), + Recent Work (OpenRouter 98% consensus Grok-beta/Claude-3.5-Sonnet/GPT-4o/DeepSeek-Coder-V2/Qwen2.5 hooks for arb/health, commissioning spot gates, ATO CSV gen).

Autonomous Pipeline (Plan-Do-Check-Act - Full Coverage):
1. Plan & Clone: Clone GitHub repo to temp/ultimate-lyra-github (git clone [YOUR_GITHUB_URL]). Unpack Sand history ZIP to temp/history. Backup all to /ultimate_backup/ (GitHub + history). Simulate diffs: "What beneficial historical/GitHub adds value without override (e.g., Manus port discoveries to health_all.sh, Sand arb docs to strats.py)?"

2. Extraction & Additive Merge (All Ever - Beneficial Only):
   - From History/GitHub: Pull everything (e.g., Manus discoveries: 152k files/22 processes/10 ports → enhance health checks; Sand 82 docs: BTCMarkets/Swyftx specs → exchange adapters; Notion/inheritance py → BaseAdapter extensions; Loops/errors → Prune but log lessons (e.g., "Avoid syntax in future")).
   - Merge Rules (100% Strict):
     - Core AU Priority: Exchanges (Swyftx/IR/BTCM/Coinbase AU only - all historical tests/probes absorbed additively, e.g., sed inherit BaseAdapter in py files).
     - Py/Scripts: Inheritance (e.g., class HistOpenRouter(OpenRouterOrchestrator): super() - hook to recent 98% consensus; au_core_cross.py + historical arb edges/tests).
     - YAML/Docker: << merges (config.yaml: *github_existing + history compliance sections like ATO_CSV: true; docker-compose.yml: Add historical port services e.g., 8080 dashboard from discoveries, depends_on vault).
     - Arb/Strats: Enhance /strategies/ (historical cross/tri + recent OpenRouter validate: await consensus_refine(edge_query) >98% before spot probe; Net post-GST calc from Sand docs).
     - Systems/Dashboards: 10 ports from history (e.g., 8090 AI Orchestrator + GitHub hooks; health_all.sh + historical port scans).
     - Compliance/Commissioning: /compliance/ (All MDs merged: ABN/GST/ATO/AFSL from history/GitHub; Recent CSV gen + spot gates: Probe $1 AU-only, log basis).
     - Vault/Ngrok/Hummingbot: Extend (secrets: + historical keys/tags; pushes: + consensus data from recent; Hummingbot: + historical confs for AU cross).
     - Prune: Non-beneficial (e.g., Manus loops/syntax, unused globals/Dubai/MEXC - if in GitHub, move to /archive/).
   - Diff Check: Git diff backup shows + only (e.g., "Added 50 historical beneficial: OpenRouter arb votes, Swyftx test v3").

3. Testing & Commissioning (Full Up-to-Date - Historical + Recent):
   - Tests: pytest tests/ (100% pass: Historical forensics (ports health), recent OpenRouter mocks (98% approve), arb sim (0.1% Swyftx-IR cross), compliance (ATO CSV sample gen).
   - Health/Probes: ./health_all.sh (all 10 historical ports + ABN?); Spot commissioning: curl /run_probe?ex=swyftx&amount=1 (gates from history: Spot-only, recent OpenRouter vote).
   - Arb Live-Sim: strategies/au_core_cross.py --historical-test (Poll diffs from Sand/GitHub specs >0.1%? Consensus 98% → Probe log, net GST deduct).
   - Docker: compose build/up -d (All services from history/GitHub: Core AU exchanges + 10 systems + OpenRouter 8090; Logs clean).

4. Consensus Validation (OpenRouter/Grok - For All):
   - Every Step: Query top 5 paid models (Grok-beta/Claude/GPT-4o/DeepSeek/Qwen, API key from vault/env): "From historical Manus/Sand + GitHub, is this beneficial additive for ONE AU Lyra V5? (e.g., Port discovery + health, Swyftx probe + OpenRouter 98% safe post-GST, no cannibalize?) Approve if >98%."
   - Threshold: >98% throughout (log: e.g., "Manus History Merge: 100% Approve - +0.1% arb from Sand"); <98% → Skip/revert (e.g., "Pruned non-AU file").

5. Output & Final ONE System (Production-Ready):
   - Folder: ~/ultimate_lyra_v5_ultimate/ (~30MB) - All ever consolidated (historical beneficial + GitHub + recent).
   - Key Files: docker-compose.yml (full historical + recent services), master_deploy.sh (one-click: Backup → Merge GitHub pull → Build → Up → Test/Commission All), changelog.md (e.g., "All Ever: Manus/Sand History (10 systems/82 docs) + GitHub Files Merged Beneficial - OpenRouter 98% Arb/Compliance, Spot Gates v4").
   - ZIP: ultimate_lyra_v5_ultimate.zip (download).
   - New GitHub: Create/update ultimate-lyra-v5-ultimate (git push from merged; Commit: "Full Historical + GitHub Consolidation - Beneficial ONE System v5.3").
   - Notification: Summary ("All Done: 100% Tests Pass, Arb 0.1-0.2% Validated from History, Compliance Active - Run ./master_deploy.sh").

Rules (Absolute):
- ONE System: Unified AU core (Swyftx/IR/BTCM/Coinbase AU, spot arb, ABN/GST/ATO) - Absorb all historical/GitHub beneficial (e.g., Sand probes + GitHub Docker).
- Additive/Beneficial: No cannibalize (keep GitHub base, add historical as sub/extend); Consensus >98% on "Value from all ever? (e.g., +Historical port health, no override)".
- Prune: Manus errors/loops to /archive/ (learn: e.g., "Avoid unterminated strings"); Unused/non-AU.
- Safety: Spot-only probes; Backup all; AU Compliance (historical + recent: ATO basis in all logs).
- Full Coverage: All ever (Manus/Sand history + GitHub files) - Recent: OpenRouter hooks, tests/commissioning/exchanges.

Execute Fully: Clone → Extract/Merge → Test/Commission → Consensus → Build/Output → ZIP/Git. <40 min. Confirm: "All Ever Consolidated - ONE Beneficial AU System Ready, 100% Works."
Run & Monitor: Manus starts (tracks: "Cloning GitHub... Merging Sand history... Consensus 100% on arb..."). If prompts for GitHub token: Add via Manus Git tool.
Expected Output:
Log: "Merged 300+ historical/GitHub: Beneficial 180 (e.g., Manus ports to health_all, Sand Swyftx docs to adapter.py, GitHub Docker + OpenRouter)."
Consensus Examples: "Historical Merge: 100% Approve (Grok: 'Additive port discoveries boost health'; Claude: 'Safe post-GST arb from Sand')."
Tests: "pytest 100%/Health 10/10/Commission: Spot probes AU-only/Arb Sim: 0.12% Net Approved."
Deliverables: ZIP download + GitHub link (e.g., github.com/[user]/ultimate-lyra-v5-ultimate). Changelog: "All Ever: Manus/Sand (Discoveries/82 Docs) + GitHub (Files/Zips) = ONE System - Recent OpenRouter/Arb/Compliance Integrated."
Deploy Local: Unzip → cd ultimate_lyra_v5_ultimate && ./master_deploy.sh → "Up: All systems, consensus active."
Step 3: Post-Merger Verification & Go-Live (5 Min Locally)
Clone/Pull New Repo: git clone [Manus GitHub URL] ~/lyra_one_system && cd ~/lyra_one_system.
Full Test: ./master_deploy.sh → Docker up, health_all.sh (ports ok), python au_core_cross.py --test (98% consensus on historical edge).
Commission/Compliance: ./commission_all.sh (spot probes from Sand history), check ATO CSVs (GitHub + recent gen).
Arb Sim: Hummingbot shell → Load strat → Poll → "Consensus from all ever: Approved 100% (net 0.1% post-GST)."
If Gaps: Manus notifies (e.g., "98% on merge - Minor historical prune"); Rerun with refined prompt.
This gets everything ever (Manus/Sand history + GitHub all) into ONE beneficial system—filtered, merged, tested. Run Step 1 Sand first, then Manus. Share GitHub URL/output if stuck. Ready for the merge? 🚀
