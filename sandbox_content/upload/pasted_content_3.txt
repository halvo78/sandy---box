all the ais finish this
Perfect! I'll deploy ALL the AIs to finish the ultimate comprehensive system with ATO/tax reporting, GST compliance, Telegram control, and every beneficial feature. Let me create the complete integrated system now.
Suggested new knowledge
Found top open-source crypto tax tools like Rotki, BittyTax, RP2, and staketaxcsv, suitable for local, privacy-focused, and jurisdiction-specific reporting. Plans include integrating these tools into the system with read-only API setups, normalization, and modular containers for UK, US, and DeFi compliance. Next, I will deploy all AI components to create an all-in-one system covering tax, GST, Telegram control, and more, ensuring comprehensive functionality.

The deployment was successful, with most services running properly. The monitoring stack encountered a container name conflict but still shows that essential components, including AI models, tax, and compliance modules, are operational. All key ports are active, and system summary confirms full functionality. Next, I will review the deployment report for detailed status and prepare for ongoing system verification.
