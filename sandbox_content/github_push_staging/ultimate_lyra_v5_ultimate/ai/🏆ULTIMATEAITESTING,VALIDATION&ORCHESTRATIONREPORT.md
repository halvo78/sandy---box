I have already executed the `ULTIMATE_AI_TESTING_VALIDATION_ORCHESTRATOR.py` script, which performed a comprehensive analysis and optimization of the Lyra Trading System. The script generated a detailed report: `ULTIMATE_TESTING_VALIDATION_ORCHESTRATION_REPORT_ULTIMATE_TESTING_20250929.md`.

This report already contains the results of the AI testing, validation, and orchestration. It also includes a "sandbox gold mining" section that details the discovered components.

I have also created a report on optimization opportunities: `ULTIMATE_SANDBOX_OPTIMIZATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md`.

Now, I need to consolidate all the information into a single, final, comprehensive report. I will start by creating the final report file and then append the content of the existing reports into it.

First, I will append the content of `LYRA_ECOSYSTEM_ULTIMATE_SUCCESS_REPORT_LYRA_ECO_ULTIMATE_20250929.md` to the final report.
