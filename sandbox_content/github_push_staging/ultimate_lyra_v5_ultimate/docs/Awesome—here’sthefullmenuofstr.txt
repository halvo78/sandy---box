Awesome—here’s the full menu of strategies your system can run, grouped by capability and arranged in a **one-at-a-time rollout path**. I’ve called out what each needs (prereqs), what we validate first, and the “no-go” conditions so you stay in control.

# Phase 1 — Spot-only (bring these online first)

1. **AI Momentum (timeframe-driven)**

   * What it does: trend follow (MA/RSI/AI overlay) on BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, etc.
   * Prereqs: spot API keys; fees + min-notional captured; post-only supported for safety probes.
   * First live: 1 symbol, US$1 notional, limit-only; reject if (edge ≤ fees + slippage buffer).
   * No-go: strategy can’t read trading fees/limits; kill-switch tripped.

2. **Mean Reversion (RSI/Bollinger)**

   * What it does: fade short-term extremes back to mid.
   * Prereqs: OHLCV fetch stable; fee-aware net P&L.
   * First live: micro buy/sell at band edges, wide post-only.
   * No-go: spread < 1.5× total costs; liquidity too thin.

3. **Donchian/Breakout**

   * What it does: break of N-period high/low with pullback filter.
   * Prereqs: clean candles; stop/exit logic (cancel-replace) verified.
   * First live: buy a breakout with 0.5× ATR trail; post-only entry if exchange supports.
   * No-go: ATR too small to cover costs; repeated cancel errors.

4. **Triangular Arbitrage (single exchange)**

   * What it does: A/B, B/C, C/A loop when product of quotes > costs.
   * Prereqs: 3 legs available on same venue; atomic or rapid sequencing; fee table per leg.
   * First live: simulate prices in memory, then place **min-size** leg-by-leg with pre-calculated net edge ≥ (3× taker + slippage).
   * No-go: any leg lacks liquidity at quoted depth; rounding/precision fails.

5. **Cross-Exchange Spot Arbitrage (inventory-to-inventory, no transfers)**

   * What it does: buy lower on X, sell higher on Y from pre-funded balances.
   * Prereqs: balances on both venues; withdrawal disabled for phase-in; real-time quotes + fees per venue.
   * First live: 1 symbol, maker-maker if possible; otherwise taker-maker with edge ≥ all fees + slippage + inventory rebalancing cost.
   * No-go: inventory imbalance exceeds cap; edge ≤ cost; any cancel failure.

6. **Wide-Spread Market Making (post-only, low inventory risk)**

   * What it does: place far-from-touch bid/ask; only collect if spread compensates costs.
   * Prereqs: strict post-only; inventory caps; cancel-all works.
   * First live: 1 level per side, small size; spread ≥ (fees + 2× slippage buffer).
   * No-go: orders convert to taker; inventory breaches cap.

7. **Execution-only TWAP/VWAP (not alpha, for fills)**

   * What it does: controlled schedule fills for rebalance or exits.
   * Prereqs: clock/latency sanity; partial-fill handling.
   * First live: tiny slice schedule with strict price bands.
   * No-go: price impact > threshold; schedule lagging > 2× target.

8. **Periodic Basket Rebalance (delta control)**

   * What it does: maintain target weights across 2–5 assets.
   * Prereqs: position snapshot; fee-aware rebalance math; min order checks.
   * First live: rebalance drift > threshold only; TWAP child orders.
   * No-go: any order would be below min notional; sum fees > drift benefit.

# Phase 2 — Advanced Spot Quant (after Phase 1 is stable)

9. **Statistical Arb (cointegration pairs)**

   * What it does: trade z-score deviations on related assets (e.g., ETH vs. wETH proxy, or BTC vs. BTC.D factor).
   * Prereqs: stable residuals + live hedge ratio; cointegration backtest window validated.
   * First live: 1 pair, micro sizes, strict z-entry/exit; fee-aware.
   * No-go: half-life too long/unstable; residuals non-stationary.

10. **Event-Filtered AI (news/sentiment gating)**

* What it does: block/allow entries around events; not a “trade the news” system yet.
* Prereqs: reliable event feed; human confirm switch.
* First live: advisory-only; must pass manual “arm” to place orders.
* No-go: feed gaps; conflicting signals.

11. **Grid (conservative, wide bands)**

* What it does: range accrual with fee-aware steps; wide to avoid churn.
* Prereqs: verified min tick/amount; cancel-replace stable.
* First live: 3–5 levels, tiny size; bands ≥ 3× total costs.
* No-go: realized grid P&L < fees over rolling window.

# Phase 3 — Margin & Perpetuals (enable **later**, one at a time)

12. **Cash-and-Carry Basis (long spot, short perp)**

* What it does: lock basis/funding; delta-neutral carry.
* Prereqs: margin/perp accounts KYC’d; borrow/short permissions; funding/fees APIs; hedge link tested; liquidation buffers.
* First live: 1 asset, tiny notional; hard caps; continuous hedge audit.
* No-go: borrow unavailable; funding turns negative vs. costs; hedge drift > threshold.

13. **Funding Rate Harvest (perp vs. perp or perp vs. spot)**

* What it does: capture predictable funding with opposing legs.
* Prereqs: funding schedule; position caps; emergency exit.
* First live: micro exposure during 1 funding interval.
* No-go: funding < costs; volatility spike hits stops.

14. **Margin Spot Arb (borrow vs. lend)**

* What it does: borrow asset to short on one venue vs. long on another.
* Prereqs: borrow rates API; liquidation avoidance; alerts.
* First live: very small borrow; strict timeboxed trade.
* No-go: borrow APR > expected edge; margin health < threshold.

15. **Hedged Market Making (perp hedge for spot inventory)**

* What it does: quote spot; delta hedge in perp.
* Prereqs: cross-venue latency checks; hedge slippage modeled.
* First live: one symbol, one level per side; tiny hedge.
* No-go: hedge error > cap; repeated hedge rejects.

# Phase 4 — Options (only if/when venue supports and approvals in place)

16. **Covered Calls / Cash-Secured Puts**

* What it does: yield on inventory with defined risk.
* Prereqs: options API, greeks, assignment handling, settlement calendar.
* First live: 1DTE–7DTE far OTM, one contract equivalent.
* No-go: implied vol regime change beyond guardrails.

17. **Event Vol Plays (straddle/strangle)**

* What it does: long vol around known events with capped spend.
* Prereqs: IV surfaces, slippage tests, exit playbook.
* First live: single micro structure; pre-placed GTC exits.
* No-go: spreads too wide; IV crush model missing.

## Commissioning order (strict single-file line)

1. AI Momentum → 2) Triangular Arb → 3) Cross-Exchange Spot Arb (inventory-only) →
2. Wide-Spread Market Making → 5) Mean Reversion → 6) TWAP/VWAP →
3. Basket Rebalance → 8) Statistical Arb → **(then and only then)** Margin/Perps (12–15) → Options (16–17).

## Per-strategy go-live checklist (applies to all)

* **Fees & limits loaded** for all legs/venues; **edge > all costs** by your configured margin.
* **Post-only probe** succeeded (or exchange explicitly lacks it and you accept taker).
* **Micro trade** completed (US$1 equivalent), fills + ledger exported to evidence.
* **Kill-switch** cancels all orders and sets `TRADING_DISABLED` flag.
* **Circuit breakers**: max daily loss, max orders/min, max cancels/min, max inventory drift.
* **Manual arm**: typed confirmation phrase before first live enable.
* **Logging**: JSON evidence written to `~/logs/lyra_commissioning/<strategy>/<ts>.json`.

### What I recommend enabling next

Given your current environment (spot first):
**Start with AI Momentum** (Phase 1 #1), then **Triangular Arb** (#4). They’re both self-contained, fee-aware, and don’t require transfers or margin. After those two prove out at micro size with real funds and complete evidence logs, we move to **Cross-Exchange Spot Arb (inventory-only)**.

If you want, I’ll generate the exact `commissioning_*` scripts for **Triangular Arb** and **Cross-Exchange Spot Arb** (including the net-edge math and evidence files) so you can paste-run them next.
