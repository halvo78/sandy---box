### SIGNOFF

Based on my analysis of the Lyra Trading System log stream, I have identified several points of concern that require attention:

1. **ANOMALY** - Deviations from Normal Trading Patterns:
   - In recent weeks, there have been frequent deviations from the standard trading patterns. These anomalies are characterized by sudden spikes in trading volume and frequent switches between different trading pairs, which deviate from the established norms.

2. **SYSTEM_ERROR** - Trading System Issues:
   - The system experienced several temporary outages, resulting in lags in trade executions and missed opportunities. Furthermore, there were repeated instances of trades being duplicated, leading to unnecessary exposure and financial risk.

3. **EXCHANGE_DISRUPTION** - Exchange API Problems:
   - We encountered multiple API disruptions, particularly during high-frequency trading periods. These disruptions led to delays in order placement and execution, causing missed trading opportunities and increased exposure to market volatility.

4. **RISK_OVERREACH** - Violations of Risk Rules:
   - Several trades violated pre-set risk limits
