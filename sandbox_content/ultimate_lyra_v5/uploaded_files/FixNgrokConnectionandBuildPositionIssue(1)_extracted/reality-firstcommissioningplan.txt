Alright—here’s a single, locked-down, reality-first commissioning plan that assumes spot only, no sim, human-confirmed actions, and auditable proof at every gate. I’m basing this on what’s already in your inheritance bundle (ngrok control plane, vault path, module layout, launcher, etc.) so we don’t reinvent anything you’ve shipped.

Zero-risk immediate actions (do these first)

Rotate & quarantine the OpenRouter keys that were written to disk/chat. Your bundle shows 8 keys in plain text; treat these as compromised, rotate them, then move new values into the vault (not .env). Remove the old .env from disk and history.

# remove leaked file, lock history, and rotate keys on provider side before replacing
shred -u ~/ultimate_lyra_systems/.env
sed -i 's/HISTFILE=/#HISTFILE=/' ~/.bashrc && history -c


Lock permissions you already created (vault + code):

chmod 700 ~/.lyra-vault; chmod 600 ~/.lyra-vault/* 2>/dev/null || true
chmod -R 755 ~/ultimate_lyra_systems

Commissioning master flow (11 gates, all auditable)

Gate 0 — Inheritance sanity (existing control plane)
Confirm ngrok/ingest health and local service endpoints you already run for remote ops. Expect a 200 from /health. Keep using the same control plane on 8081.

Gate 1 — System reality sweep
Machine, Python venv, Docker, network time, file perms, and vault sanity.

# 01_reality_sweep.sh
set -euo pipefail
echo "== SYSTEM =="
uname -a; lsb_release -a || true
echo "== TIME =="
date -Is
echo "== DOCKER =="
docker --version; docker ps --format 'table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}' || true
echo "== PYTHON VENV =="
source ~/ultimate_lyra_systems/venv/bin/activate && python -V && pip -V
echo "== NETWORK =="
getent hosts binance.com okx.com google.com | sed 's/^/  /'
echo "== PERMS =="
stat -c '%A %U %G %n' ~/.lyra-vault ~/ultimate_lyra_systems | sed 's/^/  /'
echo "== VAULT EXISTS? =="
test -d ~/.lyra-vault && echo "vault: OK" || (echo "vault: MISSING"; exit 1)


Gate 2 — Vault-only secrets (no plaintext env)
Replace any code that reads exchange/API secrets from .env with calls to your vault interface so nothing leaks. Your bundle already has a vault path/interface—use it as the single source of truth.

Gate 3 — Exchange read-only commissioning (spot-only)
No orders yet. We strictly load markets, fees, min notional/precision, balances and persist them. The script below fails closed on any mismatch and writes an evidence JSON.

# 03_exchange_readiness.py
import json, sys, time
from datetime import datetime
import ccxt

EXCHANGES = {
    # fill from vault at runtime; placeholders here
    "binance": {"apiKey": "...", "secret": "...", "options": {"defaultType": "spot"}},
    "okx":     {"apiKey": "...", "secret": "...", "password": "...", "options": {"defaultType": "spot"}},
}

symbols = ["BTC/USDT","ETH/USDT"]
report = {"timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()+"Z", "exchanges": {}}

for name, creds in EXCHANGES.items():
    ex = getattr(ccxt, name)({**creds, "enableRateLimit": True})
    ex.load_markets()
    # sanity: spot only
    for s in symbols:
        if s not in ex.symbols:
            raise SystemExit(f"[{name}] missing symbol {s}")
    fees = {}
    try:
        fees = ex.fetch_trading_fees() or {}
    except Exception:
        # fallback to market.taker, market.maker
        for s in symbols:
            m = ex.market(s)
            fees[s] = {"maker": m.get("maker", None), "taker": m.get("taker", None)}

    balances = ex.fetch_balance()
    meta = {"markets_checked": symbols, "fees": fees, "balance_keys": list(balances.keys())}
    # verify min limits
    limits_ok = {}
    for s in symbols:
        m = ex.market(s)
        price_min = (m.get("limits", {}).get("price", {}) or {}).get("min")
        amt_min   = (m.get("limits", {}).get("amount", {}) or {}).get("min")
        limits_ok[s] = {"min_price": price_min, "min_amount": amt_min}
    report["exchanges"][name] = {**meta, "limits": limits_ok}

with open("commissioning_exchange_readiness.json","w") as f:
    json.dump(report, f, indent=2)
print("OK: wrote commissioning_exchange_readiness.json")


Gate 4 — Fee-aware net-profit engine (readiness check)
Augment your strategies so every signal computes net of maker/taker, withdrawal, funding (N/A for spot), and slippage allowance using the captured fees. Refuse any signal where expected_edge <= total_costs.

Gate 5 — No-fill safety probe (post-only, far-from-touch)
We place a single post-only limit far from the touch per exchange/symbol to validate order creation/cancel pathways without fills. (Exchanges differ: use postOnly: True or timeInForce: 'PO' where supported; if not supported, skip.)

# 05_probe_postonly.py
import ccxt, time
name, symbol = sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2]  # e.g. binance BTC/USDT
ex = getattr(ccxt, name)({...vault_creds...})
ex.load_markets()
ticker = ex.fetch_ticker(symbol)
far_price = ticker['last'] * 0.1  # 90% below market -> won't fill
order = ex.create_order(symbol, 'limit', 'buy', amount=0.001, price=far_price, params={"postOnly": True})
time.sleep(2)
ex.cancel_order(order['id'], symbol)
print("OK: create/cancel flow works (post-only, far-from-touch)")


Gate 6 — Kill-switch & circuit breakers
A single Python that cancels all open orders across enabled exchanges and sets a “trading_disabled” flag file. Wire this into your dashboard panic button.

# 06_kill_switch.py
import ccxt, json, pathlib
flag = pathlib.Path("/tmp/LYRA_TRADING_DISABLED")
flag.write_text("disabled")
for name in ["binance","okx"]:
    ex = getattr(ccxt, name)({...vault_creds...})
    ex.load_markets()
    for o in ex.fetch_open_orders(): ex.cancel_order(o['id'], o['symbol'])
print("ALL ORDERS CANCELED; TRADING DISABLED")


Gate 7 — Human-in-the-loop arming (no sim, micro-size)
A wrapper that refuses to arm unless the operator types a challenge phrase and all previous evidence files exist. Only after that do we allow a single micro trade (e.g., US$1 notional) on one symbol per exchange, with immediate cancel/TP to verify fills/ledger entries. (Never run if any exchange lacks balances/limits/fees.)

# 07_arm_and_micro.sh
set -euo pipefail
for f in commissioning_exchange_readiness.json; do
  test -f "$f" || { echo "Missing $f"; exit 1; }
done
read -p "Type EXACTLY: I UNDERSTAND REAL FUNDS: " ok
test "$ok" = "I UNDERSTAND REAL FUNDS"
python 07_micro_trade.py --exchange binance --symbol BTC/USDT --notional 1.00


Gate 8 — Observability & evidence
Export Prometheus metrics + structured JSON logs for every gate and stash in ~/logs/lyra_commissioning/. You already planned Prom/Grafana—keep it and add these scrapes.

Gate 9 — Hummingbot integration (present but off)
Keep Hummingbot configs on disk and disabled until Gates 1–8 pass; then start read-only status and metrics only. (Your bundle assumes co-location of Hummingbot beside your control plane, not over it.)

# hummingbot.docker-compose.yml (excerpt)
version: "3.8"
services:
  hummingbot:
    image: hummingbot/hummingbot:latest
    env_file: []  # NO .env with secrets; inject at runtime from vault wrapper
    volumes:
      - ./hummingbot_integration/strategies:/conf/strategies:ro
      - ./logs:/logs
    command: ["bash","-lc","hummingbot --status"]  # status-only first


Gate 10 — Go/No-Go checklist (sign & ship)

✅ Gate 0–8 evidence files exist and pass

✅ Kill-switch tested

✅ Hummingbot status ok (no strategies running)

✅ Compliance checklist signed (below)
If any item missing → NO GO.

Compliance, safety & production controls (concise)

KYC/AML & terms: You must operate only from exchange accounts that passed KYC and are permitted for automated spot trading. Ensure your automation respects rate limits, post-only flags, symbol filters, and ToS.
Records: Keep immutable JSON of orders, fills, balances, fees, IPs, timestamps for 7+ years (local + offsite).
Taxes & financial reporting: Export realized P/L and cost basis; retain exchange statements.
Security: Secrets only in vault; rotate on schedule; MFA on exchange UIs; principle of least privilege (IP whitelisting where supported).
Change control: Any code change requires a dry Gate-1→5 rerun + sign-off; pin versions; tag releases; maintain rollback (launcher already exists).
Standards touchpoints: Map controls to common sections (asset mgmt, access control, logging/monitoring, change mgmt, incident response).
(Your inheritance docs already position ngrok + ops plane as the control point—keep that with a strict “nothing runs until health is 200 and vault is OK.”)

“Best AI possible” — use, but gated

Keep AI as an advisory layer only; model outputs cannot place orders without Gates 1–7 satisfied and your typed confirmation. Your bundle already outlines AI-refinement loops feeding trading decisions—retain the human gate + risk score threshold before any live call.

What you already have (and we’re reusing)

Ngrok control + ingest commands for health and remote checks.

System file structure & modules (main_trading_system.py, ai_integration.py, trading_strategies.py, dashboard.py, vault_interface.py).

Complete inheritance package with commissioning artifacts & upload manifest (we won’t duplicate—only add evidence files).

Run order (copy/paste)
# 0) Control plane alive?
curl -sf http://localhost:8081/health && echo OK

# 1) Reality sweep
bash 01_reality_sweep.sh

# 2) Vault-only secrets confirmed (no .env creds)

# 3) Exchange read-only commissioning
python 03_exchange_readiness.py && jq . commissioning_exchange_readiness.json

# 4) Net-profit calc wired in strategies (refuse if edge <= costs)

# 5) No-fill probe (one exchange & symbol first)
python 05_probe_postonly.py binance BTC/USDT

# 6) Kill-switch dry-run
python 06_kill_switch.py

# 7) Human-armed micro live test (US$1 notional)
bash 07_arm_and_micro.sh

# 8) Prom/Graf evidence: check ~/logs/lyra_commissioning/*

# 9) Hummingbot status-only (no strategies yet)
docker compose -f hummingbot.docker-compose.yml up -d
docker logs -f hummingbot

# 10) Go/No-Go checklist → then enable first live strategy


If you want, I can also supply minimal, clean re-skeletons for the corrupted files you created earlier (some of your sed edits garbled logging and AI init); but the commissioning suite above keeps trading off until every gate proves the path end-to-end, under your manual control.

When you’re ready, paste back the outputs of:

bash 01_reality_sweep.sh

python 03_exchange_readiness.py (and the JSON)

python 05_probe_postonly.py …

From there, we’ll step you through arming one exchange, one symbol, US$1 notional, then expand methodically
