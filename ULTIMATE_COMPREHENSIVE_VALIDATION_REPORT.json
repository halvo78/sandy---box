The security score of 93.4 is significantly below the required threshold of 99.0, indicating vulnerabilities that could be exploited in a live trading environment. SSL certificates need validation, open ports require securing, and encryption must be fully enabled to protect sensitive data. These issues pose a substantial risk to the integrity and security of the trading system, which is unacceptable for handling real money transactions. Immediate attention and remediation of these security aspects are mandatory before considering a go-live decision.
