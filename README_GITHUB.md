# Ultimate Lyra Trading System - GitHub Deployment

This document provides instructions for deploying the sanitized version of the Ultimate Lyra Trading System to a public GitHub repository.

## 1. Unpack the Archive

First, unpack the `ULTIMATE_LYRA_PUBLIC_CLEAN.tar.gz` archive. This will create a directory named `ULTIMATE_LYRA_PUBLIC` containing all the system files.

```bash
tar -xzvf ULTIMATE_LYRA_PUBLIC_CLEAN.tar.gz
```

## 2. Initialize a Git Repository

Navigate into the `ULTIMATE_LYRA_PUBLIC` directory and initialize a new Git repository.

```bash
cd ULTIMATE_LYRA_PUBLIC
git init
```

## 3. Create a New Repository on GitHub

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new public repository. Do **not** initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license file, as these are already included in the project.

## 4. Add the Remote Repository

Add the newly created GitHub repository as a remote for your local repository. Replace `<your-username>` and `<your-repo-name>` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
```

## 5. Add, Commit, and Push the Files

Add all the files to the staging area, commit them, and push them to the remote repository.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of the Ultimate Lyra Trading System"
git push -u origin main
```

## 6. Verify the Files on GitHub

Go to your GitHub repository in your web browser and verify that all the files have been uploaded correctly. The repository should now contain the complete, sanitized source code of the Ultimate Lyra Trading System.

## Important Note on API Keys

All API keys and sensitive information have been removed from this version of the system. To make the system operational, you will need to manually add your own API keys to the relevant configuration files (files ending in `.env` and `.py` configuration files).
