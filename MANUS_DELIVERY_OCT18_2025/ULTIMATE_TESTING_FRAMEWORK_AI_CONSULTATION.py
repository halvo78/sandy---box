You are part of the ULTIMATE AI HIVE MIND designing the BEST-IN-THE-WORLD TESTING FRAMEWORK.

MISSION: Design a testing framework that ensures EVERY trading strategy (all 230+) is tested to the FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE with HIGHEST STANDARDS and CERTIFIED.

CONTEXT:
- We have 230+ trading strategies (momentum, arbitrage, HFT, market making, ML, options, etc.)
- Each strategy MUST be tested to the absolute highest standards
- Each strategy MUST be certified as production-ready
- NO strategy goes live without 100% validation
- This is for REAL MONEY trading - zero tolerance for errors

YOUR ROLE: {role}

CRITICAL QUESTIONS:

1. **Testing Methodology**
   - What testing methods ensure strategies are BEST-IN-THE-WORLD?
   - How do we test ALL 230+ strategies comprehensively?
   - What are the industry-standard testing frameworks?

2. **Testing Levels**
   - Unit testing for each strategy component?
   - Integration testing across strategies?
   - System testing for the complete platform?
   - Acceptance testing criteria?

3. **Backtesting Requirements**
   - How many years of historical data?
   - What market conditions must be tested?
   - How do we avoid overfitting?
   - What metrics prove a strategy works?

4. **Forward Testing**
   - Paper trading duration required?
   - Live market simulation requirements?
   - What success criteria before going live?

5. **Stress Testing**
   - Black swan events (2008 crash, COVID crash, etc.)?
   - Flash crashes and extreme volatility?
   - Liquidity crises?
   - Exchange outages?

6. **Performance Metrics**
   - What metrics MUST every strategy achieve?
   - Sharpe ratio requirements?
   - Maximum drawdown limits?
   - Win rate minimums?
   - Risk-adjusted returns?

7. **Certification Standards**
   - What ISO standards apply to trading system testing?
   - Finance industry certification requirements?
   - Third-party validation needed?
   - Audit requirements?

8. **Continuous Testing**
   - How do we test strategies continuously in production?
   - Real-time performance monitoring?
   - Automatic strategy disabling if performance degrades?

9. **AI-Driven Testing**
   - How do we use 327+ AI models to test strategies?
   - AI-generated test scenarios?
   - AI validation of results?

10. **Best Practices**
    - What do the world's best trading firms do?
    - Renaissance Technologies testing approach?
    - Citadel testing standards?
    - Two Sigma methodology?

DELIVERABLE:
Provide a COMPREHENSIVE testing framework (1500-2000 words) that covers:
- Complete testing methodology
- All testing levels and types
- Specific metrics and thresholds
- Certification process
- Timeline for testing 230+ strategies
- How to ensure EVERY strategy is BEST-IN-THE-WORLD

Be SPECIFIC, TECHNICAL, and ACTIONABLE. This framework will be used to test strategies with REAL MONEY.
